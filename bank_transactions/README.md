# Bank transactions
This project implement supervised machine learning topics for a prediction problem.

## Problem statement
Given the data from a phone campaing of a bank, the goal is to implement an algorithm that allows to predict if for a future campaign the clients will subscribe to the offer. Also, is valuable to identify those factors that impact more in the clients decision. 

## Methodology
For the development of this project, we are going to use the following methodology: 
- Exploratory data analysis
- Machine learning models
    - Model 1: Logistic regresion
    - Model 2: SVM
    - Model 3: Random Forest
- Final thoghts

## Notebooks
To avoid a very long and confusing notebook, this proect is developed in different notebooks. Each one, follows an step of the proposal methodology. 
- 1.0_bank_transations_EDA: Exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing. 
- 2.1_bank_transations_logistic_regresion: Model implementation and validation.
- 2.2_bank_transactions_SVM: Model implementation and validation.
- 2.3_bank_transactions_random_forest: Model implementation and validation.
- 3.0_bank_transactions_final: Final comments related with the insights found.
